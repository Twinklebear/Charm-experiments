# aobench

This example is based on Syoyo Fujita's [aobench](https://github.com/syoyo/aobench) (also see
the [Google code page](https://code.google.com/archive/p/aobench/)).

This implementation will iteratively take samples to allow the Charm++ load balancer to re-balance
the workload while rendering.
